I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade.
And though the news was rather sad,
I just had to laugh,
I saw the photograph.

He blew his mind out in a car.
He didn't notice that the lights had changed.
A crowd a people stood and stared,
They'd seen his face before.
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today, oh boy.
The English army had just won the war.
A crowd of people turned away,
But I just had to look.
Having read the book,
I'd love to turn you on.

Woke up fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head.
Found my way down stairs and drunk a cup
And looking up I notice I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat,
Made the bus is second flat.
Found my way up stairs and hot a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream.

I heard the news today, oh boy.
Four thousand holes in Blackburn Lancashire.
And though the holes were rather small,
They had to count them all.
Now they know haw many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.
I'd love to turn you on.

It's been a hard days night,
And I've been working like a dog,
It's been a hard days night,
I should be sleeping like a log.
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright.

You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things,
And it's worth it just to hear you say,
You're gonna give me ev'rything.
So why on earth should I moan,
'Cos when I get you alone,
You know I feel OK.

When I home ev'rything seems to be right,
When I home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah.

So why on earth should I moan,
'Cos when I get you alone,
You know I feel OK.

When I home ev'rything seems to be right,
When I home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah.

Words are flying out like endless rain into a paper cup,
They slither while, they pass, they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind,
Possessing and caressing me.

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,
That call me on and on across the universe,
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box,
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing through my open views
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe.

Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Tomorrow I'll miss you,
Remember I'll always be true.

And then while I'm away,
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my loving to you.

I'll pretend that I'm kissing the lips
I'm missing and hope that my dreams
Will come true.

And then while I'm away,
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my loving to you.

All my loving I will send to you
All my loving darling, I'll be true.

I give her all my love
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her too.
I love her.

She gives me everything
And tenderly;
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me,
And I love her.

I love like ours could never die
As long as I have you near me.

Bright are the stars that shine,
Dark is the sky.
I know this love of mine
Could never die,
And I love her.

Bright are the stars that shine,
Dark is the sky.
I know this love of mine
Could never die,
And I love her.

You tell me that you've got ev'rything you want
And your bird can sing,
But you don't get me,
You don't get me!
You say you've seen seven wonders
And your bird is green,
But you can't see me,
You can't see me!

You called and asked me girl
To set you free, girl.
You say he loves you more than me
I would set you free,
Go with him,
Ah, go with him, ah

Anna, girl, before you go now
I want you to know now
That I still love you so
But if he loves you more
Go with him.

Ah, all of my life
I've been searching for a girl
To love me like I love you.
Oh, now, but every girl I've ever had
Breaks my heart and leaves me sad
What am I, what am I supposed to do oh, oh, oh, oh.

Anna, just one more thing, girl
You give back your ring to me
And I would set you free,
Go with him.

Ah, all of my life
I've been searching for a girl
To love me like I love you
But let me tell you now about every girl I've ever had
Breaks my heart and leaves me sad
What am I, what am I supposed to do oh, oh, oh, oh.

Anna, just one more thing, girl
You give back your ring to me
And I would set you free,
Go with him,
Go with him,
Ah, go with him.
You can go with him, girl.
Go with him.

Ev'ry day she takes a morning bath she wets her hair
Wraps a tow'l around her as she's heading for the bedroom chair.
It's just another day.
Slipping into stockings, slipping into shoes
Dipping in the pocket of her raincoat
It's just another day.
At the office where the papers grow she takes a break
Drinks another coffee and she finds it hard to stay awake

It's just another day,
It's just another day,
It's just another day,
It's just another day.

So sad, so sad,
Sometimes she feels so sad.
Alone in her apartment she'd dance
Till the man of her dreams comes to break the spell.
Ah stay don't stand around and he comes and he comes
But he leaves the next day.
So sad.
Sometimes she feels so sad.

As the post another letter to the sound of five
People gather round her and she finds it hard to stay alive

It's just another day,
It's just another day,
It's just another day,
It's just another day.

So sad, so sad,
Sometimes she feels so sad.
Alone in her apartment she'd dance
Till the man of her dreams comes to break the spell.
Ah stay don't stand around and he comes and he comes
But he leaves the next day.
So sad.
Sometimes she feels so sad.

Ev'ry day she takes a morning bath she wets her hair
Wraps a tow'l around her as she's heading for the bedroom chair.

It's just another day,
It's just another day,
It's just another day,
It's just another day.

For I have got another girl, another girl.
You've making me say that I've got nobody but you,
But as from today, well I've got somebody that's new.
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want
For I have got another girl, another girl.

She sweeter than all the girls and I've met quite a few.
Nobody in all the world can do what she can do,
And so I'm telling you, this time you'd better stop,
For I have got another girl,
Another girl, who will love me till the end.
Through thick and thin she will always be my friend.

I don't wanna say that I've been unhappy with you,
But as from today, well I've seen somebody that's new,
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want
For I have got another girl,
Another girl, who will love me till the end.
Through thick and thin she will always be my friend.

If you need somebody to love
Just look into my eyes
I'll be there to make you feel right
If you're feeling sorry and sad
I'd really sumpathise
Don't you be sad, just call me tonight.

Any time at all, any time at all, any time at all,
All you've gotta do is call, and I'll be there.

Call me tonight and I'll come to you.

How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people,
How that you know who you are,
What do you want to be,
And have you travelled very far,
Far as eye can see?

How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people,
How often have you been there?
Often enough to know,
What did you see when you were there,
Nothing that doesn't show.

Baby you're rich man,
Baby you're rich man,
Baby you're rich man too.
You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a soo,
What a thing to do.
Baby you're rich man,
Baby you're rich man,
Baby you're rich man too.

Fiew in from Miami
Beach BOAC
Didn't get to bed last night,
On the way the paper bag was on my knee,
Man, I had a dreamful flight,

I'm back in the USSR.
You don't know how lucky you are boy,
Back in the USSR.

Been away so long
I hardly knew the place,
Gee it's good to be back home,
Leave it 'til tomorrow to unpack my case,
Honey disconnect the phone,

I'm back in the USSR.
You don't know how lucky you are boy,
Back in the USSR.

Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out,
They leave the west behind.
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout,
That Georgia's always on my mi-mi-mi-mi-mind.

Come and keep your comrade warm,

Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church
Where a wedding has been,
Lives in a dream,
Waits at the window, wearing the face
That she keeps in a jar by the door,
Who is it for?

All the lonely people, where do they all come from?
All the lonely people, where do they all belong?

Farther McCenzie, writing the words of a sermon

Here making each day of the year,
Changing my life with a wave of her hand.
Nobody can deny that there's something there.

There, running my hands through her hair;
Both of us thinking how good it can be.
Someone is speaking but she doesn't know he's there.

I want her ev'rywhere, and if she's beside me
I know I need never care,
But to love her is to meet her ev'rywhere,
Knowing that love is to share,
Each one believing that love never dies,
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there.

Child like no one understands,
Jack knife in your sweaty hands,
Some kind of innocence is measured out in years,
You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears.

Big man walking in the park,
Wigwam frightened of the dark,
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you.
You think you know it but you haven't got a clue.

You can talk to me, you can talk to me,
You can talk to me if you're lonely you can talk to me.
Hey Bulldog.

Hey Jude, don't make it bad,
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

Hey Jude, don't be afraid,
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.

And any time you feel the pain,
Hej Jude, refrain,
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.
For now you know that it's a fool
Who plays it cool by making his world a little colder.
Da da da da da da da da da da

Hey Jude, don't let me down,
You have found her, now go and get her.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

So let it out and let it in,
Hey Jude, begin,
You're waiting for someone to perform with,
And don't you know that it's just you,
Hej Jude, you'll do.
The movement you need is on your shoulder.
Da da da da da da da da da da

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember, to let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it better

It feels so right now
Hold me tight,
Tell me I'm the only one
And then I might
Never be the loney one.

Hold me tight,
Let me go on loving you
Tonight, tonight,
Making love to only you,

Don't know what it means to hold you tight,
Being here alone tonight with you.

Honey don't, honey don't, honey don't
I say you will when you won't, oh oh honey, don't.

Well I love you, baby, and you ought to know
I like the way you wear your clothes,
Everything about you is so doggone sweet,
You got that sand all over your feet.

Well sometimes I love you on a Saturday night,
Sunday morning you don't look right.
You've been out painting the town,
uh baby, been stepping around.

She was a working girl
North of England way.
Now she's hit the big time

And if she could only hear me
This is what I'd say
Honey pie you are making me crazy.
I'm in love but I'm lazy.
So won't you please come home.

Oh honey pie my position is tragic.
Come and show me the magic
Of your Hollywood song.

You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee
Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic
Sail asrocc the Atlantic
To be where you belong.

Will the wind that blew her boat
Across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me
Honey pie you are making me crazy.
I'm in love but I'm lazy.
So won't you please come home.

I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together.

Oh I can't sleep at night
Since you've been gone.
I never weep at night
I can't go on.

Well don't you know I can't take it.
I don't know who can,
I'm not going to may-a-yake it
I'm not that kind of man.

Oh I can't sleep at night
But just the same
I never weep at night
I call your name,
I call your name.

I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go.
I would hate my disappointment to show.
There's nothing for me here,
So I will disappear
If the turns up while I'm gone please let me know.

I've had a drink of two and I don't care.
There's no fun in what I do if she's not there.
I wonder what went wrong,
I've waited far too long.
I think I'll take a walk and look for her.

Though tonight she's made me sad,
I still love her.
If I find her I'll be glad,
I still love her.

I think I'll take a walk and look for her.

You don't realize how much I need you,
Love you all the time and never leave you.
Please come on back to me.
I'm lonely as can be,
I need you.

Said you had a thing or two to tell me.
How was I to know you would upset me?
I didn't realize
As I looked in your eyes
You told me,
Oh, yes, you told me,
You don't want my lovin' any more.
That's when it hurt me
And feeling like this
I just can't go on any more.

Please remember how I feel about you,
I could never really live without you,
So, come on back and see
Just what you mean to me
I need you.
You told me,
You don't want my lovin' any more.
That's when it hurt me
And feeling like this
I just can't go on any more.

Well, she was just seventeen, you know what I mean.
And the way she looked was way beyond compare.
So, how could I dance with another,
Oh, when I saw her standing there?

Well, she looked at me and I, I could see
That before too long I'd fall in love with her.
She wouldn't dance with another,
Oh, when I saw her standing there.

Well, my heart went zoom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine!

Oh, we dance through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long I fell in love with her.
Now I'll never dance with another,
Oh, since I saw her standing there.

Well, my heart went zoom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine!

Oh, we dance through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long I fell in love with her.
Now I'll never dance with another,
Oh, since I saw her standing there.
Oh, since I saw her standing there.
Oh, since I saw her standing there.

I wanna be your lover, babe,
I wanna be your man.
I wanna be your lover, babe,
I wanna be your man.

Love you like no other, babe,
Like no other can.
Love you like no other, babe,
Like no other can.

I wanna be your man,
I wanna be your man,
I wanna be your man,
I wanna be your man.

Tell me that you love me, babe,
Tell me you understand.
Tell me that you love me, babe,
I wanna be your man.

I wanna be your lover, babe,
I wanna be your man.
I wanna be your lover, babe,
I wanna be your man.

I wanna be your man,
I wanna be your man,
I wanna be your man,
I wanna be your man.

Oh, yeah, I'll tell you something
I think you'll understand,
Then I'll say that something
I wanna hold your hand,
I wanna hold your hand,
I wanna hold your hand.

Oh please say to me
You'll let me be your man,
And please say to me
You'll let me hold your hand,
Now let me hold your hand,
I wanna hold your hand.

And when I touch you
I feel happy inside,
It's such a feeling
That my love I can't hide,
I can't hide, I can't hide.

Yeah, you got that something,
I think you'll understand,
When I feel that something
I wanna hold your hand,
I wanna hold your hand,
I wanna hold your hand.

And when I touch you
I feel happy inside,
It's such a feeling
That my love I can't hide,
I can't hide, I can't hide.

Yeah, you got that something,
I think you'll understand,
When I feel that something
I wanna hold your hand,
I wanna hold your hand,
I wanna hold your hand.

I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say.
When you're here
All those words they seem to slip away.

When I get near you
The game begin to drag me down.
It's all right,
I'll make you maybe next time around.

But if I seem to get unkind,
It's only me, it's not my mind,
That is confusing things.

I want to tell you
I feel hung up and I don't know why.
I don't mind,
I could wait forever, I've got time.

Who knows how long I've loved you,
You know I love you still.
Will I wait a lonely lifetime,
If you want me to, I will.

For if I ever saw you,
I didn't catch your name.
But it never really mattered,
I will always feel the same.

Love you forever and forever,
Love you with all my heart;
Love you whenever we're together,
Love you when we're apart.

And when at last I find you,
You song will fill the air.
Sing it loud so I can hear you,
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me,
You know I will,
I will.

If I fell in love with you
Would you promice to be true
And help me understand
'Cause I've been in love before
And I fell it love was more
When just hold in hands.

If I give my heart to you,
I must be sure from very start
That you would love me more that her.

If I trust in you,
Oh, please don't run and hide.
If I you too,
Oh, please don't hurt my pride like her.
'Cause I couldn't stay in pain
And I would be sad if our new love
Was in vain.

So I hope you see
That I would love to love you,
And that see will cry
When she learns we are two,
'Cause I couldn't stay in pain
And I would be sad if our new love
Was in vain.

So I hope you see
That I would love to love you,
And that see will cry
When she learns we are two,
If I fell in love with you.

If I needed someone to love,
You're the one that I'd be thinking of,
If I needed someone.

If I had some more time to spend,
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend,
If I needed someone.

Had you come some other day then
It might not have been like this.
But you see now I'm too much in love.
Carve your number on my wall and
Maybe you will get a call from me,
If I needed someone.

If I had some more time to spend,
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend,
If I needed someone.

Had you come some other day then
It might not have been like this.
But you see now I'm too much in love.
Carve your number on my wall and
Maybe you will get a call from me,
If I needed someone.

You know if you break my heart I'll go,
But I'll be back again,
'Cause I told you once before goodbye,
But I came back again.

I love you so
Oh, I'm the one who wants you,
Yes I'm the one who wants you, oh ho, oh ho,

Oh, you could find better things to do
That to break my heart again,
This time I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend.

I thought that you would realize that
If I ran away from you
That you would want me too,
But I've got a big surprise, oh ho, oh ho,

Oh, you could find better things to do
That to break my heart again,
This time I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend.

I wanna go
But I hate to leave you,
You know I hate to leave you, oh ho, oh ho,

Oh, you, if you break my heart I'll go,
But I'll be back again.

I've got ev'ry reason on earth to be mad,
'Cause I've just lost the only girl I had.
If I could get my way,
I'd get myself locked up today,
But I can't
So I cry instead.

I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger than my feet,
I can't talk to people that I meet.
If I could see you now,
I'd try to make you say it somehow,
But I can't
So I cry instead.

Don't want to cry when there's people there,
I get shy when they start to stare,
I'm gonna hide myself away, ay hay;
But I'll come back again some day.

And when I do you'd better hide all the girls,
I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world.
Yes, I'm gonna break them in two,
And show you what your lovin' man can do,
Until then
I'll cry instead.

Don't want to cry when there's people there,
I get shy when they start to stare,
I'm gonna hide myself away, ay hay;
But I'll come back again some day.

And when I do you'd better hide all the girls,
I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world.
Yes, I'm gonna break them in two,
And show you what your lovin' man can do,
Until then
I'll cry instead.

Oh yeah, Oh yeah,
Oh yeah, Oh yeah!

Imagine I'm in love with you;
It's easy 'cause I know
I've imagined I'm in love with you
Many, many, many times before.

It's not like me to pretend,
But I'll get you, I'll get you in the end;
Yes, I will, I'll get you in the end.
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah!

I think about you night and day;
I need you and it's true,
When I think about you I can say,
I'm never, never, never, never blue,

So I'm telling you, my friend
That I'll get you, I'll get you in the end;
Yes, I will, I'll get you in the end.
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah!

Well, there's gonna be a time
When I'm gonna change your mind.
So, you might as well resign yourself to me.

I'm a loser,
I'm a loser,
I'm not what appear to be.

Of all the love I have won or have lost,
There is one love I should never have crossed.
She was a girl in a million, my friend,
I should have knows she would win in the end.

I'm a loser,
And I lost someone who's near to me.
I'm a loser,
And I'm not what I appear to be.

Although I laugh and I act like a clown,
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown.
My tears are falling like rain from the sky,
Is it for her or myself that I cry.

I'm a loser,
And I lost someone who's near to me.
I'm a loser,
And I'm not what I appear to be.

What have I done to deserve such a fate,
I realize I have left it too late.
And so it's true, pride comes before a fall,
I'm telling you so that won't lose all.

I'm a loser,
And I lost someone who's near to me.
I'm a loser,
And I'm not what I appear to be.

I don't wanna kiss or hold your hand,
If it's funny try an' understand,
There is really nothing else I'd rather do,
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you.

I don't need to hug or hold you tight,
I just wanna dance with you all night,
In this world there's nothing I would rather do,
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you.

Just to dance with you is ev'rything I need.
Before this dance is through I think I'll love you too,
I'm so happy when you dance with me.

I'm somebody tries to take my place,
Let's pretend we just can't see his face,
In this world there's nothing I would rather do,
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you.

Just to dance with you is ev'rything I need.
Before this dance is through I think I'll love you too,
I'm so happy when you dance with me.

I'm somebody tries to take my place,
Let's pretend we just can't see his face,
In this world there's nothing I would rather do,
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you.

Oh, oh,
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

I've got something to tell you
I'm in love,
I've been longing to tell you
I'm in love.
You'll believe me when I tell you
I'm in love with you.

You're my kind of girl,
You make me feel proud,
You make me want to shout aloud.

Yes, I'm telling all my friends
I'm in love.

Ev'ry night I can't sleep thinking of you,
And ev'ry little thing that you do.

Yes, I'm telling all my friends
I'm in love.

Oh, yes, I'm sittin' on top of the world,
I'm in love with a wonderful girl.
And I never felt so good before
If this is love give me more more more more.

Ev'ry night I can't sleep thinking of you,
And ev'ry little thing that you do.

Yes, I'm telling all my friends
I'm in love.

I'm looking through you,
Where did you go?
I thought I knew you,
What did I know?
You don't look diff'rent,
But you have changed.
I'm looking through you,
You're not the same.

Your lips are moving,
I cannot hear;
Your voice is soothing,
But the words aren't clear
You don't sound diff'rent,
I've learned the game
I'm looking through you,
You're not the same.

Why, tell me why did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight.

You're thinking of me
The same old way.
You were above me,
But not today.
The only diff'rence
Is you're down there.
I'm looking through you,
And you're nowhere.

Why, tell me why did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight.

I'm looking through you,
Where did you go?
I thought I knew you,
What did I know?
You don't look diff'rent,
But you have changed.
I'm looking through you,
You're not the same.

When I wake up early in the morning,
Lift my head, I'm still jawning.
When I'm in the middle of a dream,
Stay in bed, float up stream.

Please don't wake me, no don't shake me,
Leave me where I am
I'm only sleeping.

Ev'rybody seems to think I'm lazy,
I don't mind, I think they're crazy.
Running ev'rywhere at such a speed
'Til they find there's no need.

Please don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all
I'm only sleeping.

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window,
Taking my time,
Lying there and staring at the ceiling,
Waiting for a sleepy feeling.

Please don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all
I'm only sleeping.

When I wake up early in the morning,
Lift my head, I'm still jawning.
When I'm in the middle of a dream,
Stay in bed, float up stream.

Please don't wake me, no don't shake me,
Leave me where I am
I'm only sleeping.

I'm so tired,
I haven't slept a wink,
I'm so tired,
My mind is on the blink.
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink, no, no, no.

I'm so tired,
I don't know what to do,
I'm so tired,
My mind is set on you.
I wonder should I call you but I know what you would do.

You say I'm putting you on,
But it's no joke,
It's doing me harm,
You know I can't sleep,
I can't stop my brain,
You know it's three weeks,
I'm going insane,
You know I'd give you ev'rything I've got
For a little peace of mind.

There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed,
Some forever, not for better,
Some have gone and some remain.

All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall.
Some are dead and some are living,
In my life I've loved them all.

But of all these friends and lovers,
There's no one compares with you,
And these mem'ies lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new.

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before,
I know I'll often stop and think about them,
In my life I'll love you more.

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before,
I know I'll often stop and think about them,
In my life I'll love you more.
In my life I'll love you more.

It won't be long,
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
It won't be long,
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
It won't be long,
Yeah, till I belong to you.

Ev'ry night when ev'rybody has fun,
Here am I sitting all on my own.

It won't be long,
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
It won't be long,
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
It won't be long,
Yeah, till I belong to you.

Since you left me, I'm so alone;
Now you're coming, you're coming on home,
I'll be good like I know I should.
You're coming home, you're coming home.

Ev'ry night the tears come down from my eyes,
Ev'ry day I've done nothing but cry.

It won't be long,
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
It won't be long,
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
It won't be long,
Yeah, till I belong to you.

Since you left me, I'm so alone;
Now you're coming, you're coming on home,
I'll be good like I know I should.
You're coming home, you're coming home.

Ev'ry day we'll be happy I know,
Now I know that you won't leave me no more.

It won't be long,
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
It won't be long,
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
It won't be long,
Yeah, till I belong to you.

When I look into your eyes,
Your love is there for me.
And the more I go inside,
The more there is to see.

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you.
Ev'rywhere it's what you make for us
To take it's all too much.

Floating down the stream of time,
From life to life with me.
Makes no diff'rence where you are
Or where you'd like to be.

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you.
All the world is birthday cake
So take a piece, but not too much

Sail me on a silver sun,
Where I know that I'm free.
Show me that I'm ev'rywhere
And get me home for tea.

It's all too much for me to take:
There's plenty there for ev'rybody.
The more you give the more you get,
The more it is and it's too much.
It's all too much.

I'd say some day
I'm bound to give my heart away
When I do this for you.

They said that love was a lie,
Told me that I
Should never try to find
Somebody who'd be kind,
Kind to only me.

You love, true love
Seems to be all
I'm thinking of,
But it's true, it's for you.

So I just tell them they're right
Who wants a fight?
Tell them I quite agree
Nobody'd love me
Then I look at you.

And love comes, love shows,
I give my heart and no one knows
That I do; it's for you.

I get high when I see you go by, my, oh, my!
When you sigh my my inside just flies, butterflies,
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you?

It's only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love and that is all,
But it's so hard loving you.

Is it right that you and I should fight ev'ry night?
Just the sight of you makes night-time bright, very bright.
Haven't I the right to make it up girl?

It's only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love and that is all,
But it's so hard loving you,
Yes, it's so hard loving you, loving you.

I've just seen a face I can't forget the time or place where we does met,
She's just the girl for me and I want all the world to see we're met.
Mm mm mm mm mm mm.

Had it been another day I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware but as it is I'll dream of her tonight.
Da da da da da da.

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling me back again.

I have never known the like of this, I've been alone and I have missed
Things and kept out of sight for other girls were never quite like this.
Mm mm mm mm mm mm.

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling me back again.

I've just seen a face I can't forget the time or place where we does met,
She's just the girl for me and I want all the world to see we're met.
Mm mm mm mm mm mm.

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling me back again.

Half of what I say is meaning less
But I say is just to reach you, Julia.

Julia, Julia, oceanchild, calls me.
So I sing a song of love, Julia.

Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me.
So I sing a song of love, Julia.

Her hair of floating sky is shimmering,
Glimmering in the sun.

Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me.
So I sing a song of love, Julia.

When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia.

Julia, sleeping sand, silent clouds, touch me.
So I sing a song of love, Julia.

Mm mm mm calls me.
So I sing a song of love, Julia,
Julia, Julia.

Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet?
Who finds the money when you pay the rent,
Did you think that money was haven't sent?

Friday night arrives without a suitcase,
Sundayn morning creeping like a nun,
Monday's child has learned to tie his booflace.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonder how you manage to feel the rest?
See how they run.

Lady Madonna lying on the bed,
Listen to the music playing in your head.
Tuesday afternoon is never ending,
Wednesday morning papers didn't come,
Thursday night your stocking needed mending.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet?

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me,
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me,
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.

Let it be, let it be,
Let it be, let it be,
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

And when the broken-hearted people
Living in the world agree,
There will be an answer, let it be.
For though they may be parted
There is still a chance that they will see,
There will be an answer, let it be.

Let it be, let it be,
Let it be, let it be,
There will be an answer, let it be.

And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me,
Shine until tomorrow, let it be.
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me,
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.

Let it be, let it be,
Let it be, let it be,
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be,
Let it be, let it be,
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

Little child, little child,
Little child, won't you dance with me?
I'm so sad and lonely;
Baby, take a chance with me.
Little child, little child,
Little child, won't you dance with me?
I'm so sad and lonely;
Baby, take a chance with me.

If you want someone to make you feel so fine,
Then we'll have some fun when you're mine, all mine.
So come on, come on, come on.

Little child, little child,
Little child, won't you dance with me?
I'm so sad and lonely;
Baby, take a chance with me.

When you're by my side you're the only one;
Don't you run and hide, just come on, come on.
So come on, come on, come on.

Little child, little child,
Little child, won't you dance with me?
I'm so sad and lonely;
Baby, take a chance with me.
Oh, yeah! Baby, take a chance with me.

It's been a long, long, long time
How could I ever have lost you
When I loved you.

It took a long, long, long time
Now I'm so happy I found you
Now I love you.

So many tears I was searching
So many tears I was wasting, oh, oh.

No I can see you, be you
Now can I ever misplane you
How I want you
Oh, I love you
You know that I need you
Oh, I love you

Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

Celophane flowers of yellow and green,
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes and she's gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
Ev'ryone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high.

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,
Waiting to take you away.
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds and you're gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking-glass ties.
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Aaaah,
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Aaaah,
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Martha, my dear, though I spend my days
In coversation please remember me,
Martha, my love,
Don't forget me, Martha, my dear.

Hold your head up, you silly girl,
Look what you've done.
When you find yourself in the thick of it,
Help yourself to a bit
Of what is all around you.

Silly girl,
Take a good look around you,
Take a good look you've bound to see
That you and me were meant to be
For each other, silly girl.

Joan was quizzical,
Studied pataphysical
Science in the home.
Late nights all alone with a test tube,
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Maxwell Edison,
Majoring in medicine,
Calls her on the phone.
Can I take you out to the pictures,
Jo-o-o-oan?
But, as she's getting ready to go,
A knock comes on the door.

Bang! Bang!
Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon her head.
Clang! Clang!
Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was dead.

Back in school again,
Maxwell plays the fool again,
Teacher gets annoyed.
Wishing to avoid
An unpleasant sce-e-e-ene.
She tells Max to stay
When the class has gone away,
So, he waits behind.
Writing fifty times,
I must not be so-o-o-o.
But, when she turns her back on the boy,
He creeps up from behind.

Bang! Bang!
Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon her head.
Clang! Clang!
Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was dead.

PC Thirty one
Said, We're caught a dirty one.
Maxwell stands alone.
Painting testimonial pictures,
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Rose and Valerie,
Screaming from the gallery,
Say he must go free.
The judge does not agree
And he tells them so-o-o-o.
But, as the words are leaving his lips,
A noise come from behind.

Bang! Bang!
Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon his head.
Clang! Clang!
Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that he was dead.

Mean mr. Mustard sleeps in the park,
Shaves in the dark, trying to save paper.
Sleeps in a hole in the road;
Saving up to buy some clothes;
Keeps a ten bob note up his nose.
Such a mean old man,
Such a mean old man.

His sister Pam works in a shop,
She never stops, she's a go getter.
Takes him out to look at the Queen;
Only place that he's ever been.
Always shouts out something obscene.
Such a dirty old man,
Dirty old man.

Michelle, ma belle
These are words that go together well,
My Michelle.

I love you, I love you, I love you,
That's all I want to say,
Until I find a way
I will say the only words I know
That you'll understand.

I need to, I need to, I need to,
I need to make you see
Oh what you mean to me,
Until I do I'm hoping you will know
What I mean.
I love you.

I want you, I want you, I want you,
I think you know by now,
I'll get to you somehow
Until I do I'm telling you
So you'll understand.

I will say the only words I know
That you'll understand,
My Michelle.

I'm the kind of guy
Who never used to cry,
But now you're treating me bad, Misery.

I've lost you now I'm sure,
I won't see you no more.
It's gonna be a drag, Misery.

I remember all the little things we've done.
You'll remember and you'll be the lonely one, lonely one.
Please come back to me,
'Cause ev'ryone can see
Without you I will be in misery.

This happened once before
When I came to your door,
No reply,
They said it wasn't you
But I saw you
Peep through your window.

I saw the light,
I saw the light.

I know that you saw me
'Cause I looked up to see your face.

I tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
That's a lie,
'Cause I know where you've been,
I saw you walk in you door.

I nearly died,
I nearly died,

'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man
In my place.

If I were you
I'd realize
That I love you more that any other guy,
And I'll forgive
That I heard before
When you gave me no reply.

I tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
That's a lie,
'Cause I know where you've been,
I saw you walk in you door.

I nearly died,
I nearly died,

'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man
In my place.

Nobody I know could love me more that you.
You can give me so much love it seems untrue.
Listen to the bird who sings it to the tree
And then when you've heard him see if you agree.
Nobody I know could love you more than me.

Ev'rywhere I go the sun comes shining through.
Ev'ryone I know is sure it shines for you.
Even in my dreams I look into your eyes,
Suddenly it seems I've found a paradise.

Ev'rywhere I go the sun comes shining through.
It means so much to be a part of a heart of a wonderful one.
When other lovers are gone,
We'll live on, we'll live on.

I once had girl,
Or should I say,
She once had me;
She showed me her room,
Isn't it good,
Norwegian wood?
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere.
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair.

I sat on a rug,
Biding my time,
Drinking her wine,
We talked until two,
And then she said,
It's time for bed.
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh.
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath.

And when I awoke,
I was alone,
This bird had flown;
So I lit a fire,
Isn't it good,
Norwegian wood?

You know you made me cry,
I see no use in wond'ring why.
I cried for you.
And now you've changed your mind,
I see no reason to change mine.
I cried, it's through.

Oh, you're giving me the same old line,
I'm wond'ring why.
You hurt me then,
You're back again.
No, no, no,
Not a second time.

You know you made me cry,
I see no use in wond'ring why.
I cried for you.
And now you've changed your mind,
I see no reason to change mine.
I cried, it's through.

He's a real nowhere man,
Sitting in his nowhere land,
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody.

Doesn't have a point of view,
Knows not where he's going to,
Isn't he a bit like you and me?

Nowhere man, please listen,
You don't know what you're missing,
Nowhere man, the world is at your command.

He's a blind as he can be,
Just sees what he wants to see,
Nowhere man can you see me at all?

Nowhere man, don't worry,
Take your time, don't hurry,
Leave it all till somebody else lends you a hand.

Doesn't have a point of view,
Knows not where he's going to,
Isn't he a bit like you and me?

Nowhere man, please listen,
You don't know what you're missing,
Nowhere man, the world is at your command.

He's a real nowhere man,
Sitting in his nowhere land,
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody,
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody,
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody.

Desmond has a barrow in the market place.
Molly is a singer in a band.
Desmond says to Molly girl I like your face
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand.

Obladi oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on.
Obladi oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on.

Desmond takes a trolley to the jewellers stores,
Buys a twenty carat golden ring.
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing.

Obladi oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on.
Obladi oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on.

In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet howe
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones.

Happy ever after in the market place
Desmond lets the children lend a hand.
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening she still sings it with the band.

I'd like to be under sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade.

He'd let us in knows where we've been
In his octopus's garden in the shade.
I'd ask my friends to come and see
An octopus's garden with me.

I'd like to be under sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade.

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hide away beneath the waves.
Resting our heads on the sea bed
In an octopus's garden near a cave.

We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can't be found.

I'd like to be under sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade.

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves.
Oh what a joy for ev'ry girl and boy
Knowing they're happy and they're safe.

We would be so happy you and me,
No one there to tell us what to do.

I'd like to be under sea
In an octopus's garden with you.
In an octopus's garden with you.
In an octopus's garden with you.

My baby says she's trav'ling on the one after 909.
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line.
I said move over once, move over twice,
Come on baby don't be cold as ice.
I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909.

I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees.
You're only fooling around, you're only fooling around with me.
I said move over once, move over twice,
Come on baby don't be cold as ice.
I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909.

I've got my bag,
Run to the station.
Railman says
You've got the wrong location.
I've got my bag,
Run right home.
Then I find
I've got the number wrong.

If you're list'ning to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong.
But they're not.
He just wrote it like that.

When you're list'ning late at night,
You may think the bands are not quite right.
But they are.
They just play it like that.

It doesn't really matter what chords I play,
What words I say or time of day it is,
As it's only a Northern Song.

It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I tare or if my hair is brown,
When it's only a Northern Song.

If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key,
You're correct,
There's nobody there.
And I told you there's no one there.

Dear Sir or Madam will you read my book?
It took me years to write, will you take a look?
Based on a novel by a man named Lear
And I need a job so I want to be a paperback writer, paperback writer.

It's the dirty story of a dirty man,
And his clinging wife doesn't understand.
His son is working for the Daily Mail,
It's a steady job, but he wants to be a paperback writer, paperback writer.

It's thousand pages, give or take a few.
I'll be writing more in a week or two.
I can make it longer if you like the stile,
I can change it 'round and I want to be a paperback writer, paperback writer.

It you really like it you can have the things,
It could make a million for you overnight.
If you must return it you can send it here,
But I need a break and I want to be a paperback writer, paperback writer.

Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of ev'ry head he's had the pleasure to know.
And all the people that come and go stop and say hello.
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
Wet behind the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back

On the corner is a banker with a motor car.
The little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mac in the pouring rain, very strange.
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
Wet behind the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back

In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hour glass.
And in his pocket is a portrait of the queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean, it's a clean machine.
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
Full of fish and finger pies
In summer meanwhile back

In Penny Lane the barber shawes another customer.
We see the baner sitting, waiting for a trend.
And then the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain, very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
Wet behind the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
Wet behind the blue suburban skies,
Penny Lane.

She's so good looking but she looks like a man.
Well, you should see her in drag, dressed in her polythene bag.
Yes you should see Polythene Pam.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Get a dose of her in jackboot and kilt,
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt.
She's the kind of a girl that makes the News Of The World,
Yes, you could say she was attractively built.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

You say you want a revolution,
We'd better get on right away.
Well let's get on your feet, end of the street, singing.

A million workers working for nothing,
You better give them what they really own;
We gotta put you down when we come into town, singing.

I gonna ask you comrades and brothers,
How do you treat your old woman back home,
She's gotta be herself so she can give us help, singing.

If the rain comes they run and hide their heads
The night as well be dead
If the rain comes,
If the rain comes.

When the sun shines, they sleep in the shade
And sip their lemonade
When the sun shines,
When the sun shines.

All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dream
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for you

Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone

It's real love
It's real, yes it's real love
It's real

From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love

Don't need to be afraid
No need to be afraid

It's real love
It's real, yes it's real love
It's real

Thought I'd been in love before,
But in my heart I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone

It's real love
Yes it's real, yes it's real love
It's real, yes it's real love

You say you want a revolution,
Well, you know, we all want to change the world.
You tell me that it's evolution,
Well, you know, we all want to change the world.
But when you talk about destruction,
Don't you know that you can count me out
Don't you know it's gonna be alright.

You say you got a real solution,
Well, you know, we'd all love to see the plan.
You asked me for a contribution,
Well, you know, we're doing what we can.
But when you want money for people with minds that hate,
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait.
Don't you know it's gonna be alright.

You say you'll change the constitution,
Well, you know we all want to change your head.
You tell me it's the institution,
Well, you know you better free your mind instead.
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao,
You ain't going to make it with anyone, anyhow.
Don't you know it's gonna be alright.

Just let me hear some of that
Rock'n'roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock'n'roll music
If you wanna dance with me,
If you wanna dance with me.

I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beaty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony.

That's why I go for that
Rock'n'roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock'n'roll music
If you wanna dance with me,
If you wanna dance with me.

I took my loved one over'cross the tracks
So she can hear my man a wail a sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they were going like a hurrican.

That's why I go for that
Rock'n'roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock'n'roll music
If you wanna dance with me,
If you wanna dance with me.

Way down south they had a jubilee
The jokey folks they had jamboree
They're drinking home brew from a water cup
The folks dancing got all chook up

And started playing that
Rock'n'roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock'n'roll music
If you wanna dance with me,
If you wanna dance with me.

Don't care to hear 'em play a tango
I'm in the wood to hear a mambo
It's way too early for a congo
So keep a rocking that piano

That's why I go for that
Rock'n'roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock'n'roll music
If you wanna dance with me,
If you wanna dance with me.

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room only to find Gideon's Bible.
Rocky had come equipped with a gun to shoot off the legs of his rival.

His rival it seems had broken his dreams by stealing the girl of his fancy.
Her name was Magill, she called herself Lil, but ev'ryone knew her as Nancy.

Now she and her man who called himself Dan were in the next room as the show down.
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin he said,  Danny boy, this is a show down.
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot and Rocky collapsed in the garden.

Now the doctor came in stinking of gin and proceeded to lie on the table.
He said, Rocky
And Rocky said, Doc, it's only a scratch, and I'll be better,
I' be better, Doc, as soon as I'm able.

Now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back his room only to find Gideon's Bible.
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt to help with good Rocky's read Bible.

Roll over Beethoven, I gotta hear it again today

You know my temperatures rising and the juke box blowing a fuse
My heart's beating rhythm and my soul keeps a singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven and tell me Tchaikovsky she news.

I got the rocking pneumonia I need a skol of rhythm and blues
I caught the rolling arthritic sitting down at a rhythm review
Roll over Beethoven, they're rocking in two by two.

Well, if you feel you liket, go get your lover
Then reel and rock it roll it over
Then mose on up just a triffle burther
Then reel and rock with one another
Roll over Beethoven, did them rhythm and blues.

You know my temperatures nising and the juke box blowing a fuse
My heart's beating rhythm and my soul keeps a singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven and tell me Tchaikovsky she news.

I'd rather see you dead, little girl than to be with another man.
You'd better keep your head, little girl, or I won't know where I am.

You better run for your life if you can, little girl,
Hide your head in the sand, little girl,
Catch you with another man, that's the end, little girl.

Well you know that I'm a wicked guy and I was born with a jealous mind.
And I can't spend my whole life tryin' to make you toe the line.

You better run for your life if you can, little girl,
Hide your head in the sand, little girl,
Catch you with another man, that's the end, little girl.

Let this be a sermon, I mean ev'rything I said.
Baby, I'm determined and I'd rather see you dead.

You better run for your life if you can, little girl,
Hide your head in the sand, little girl,
Catch you with another man, that's the end, little girl.

I'd rather see you dead, little girl than to be with another man.
You'd better keep your head, little girl, or I won't know where I am.

You better run for your life if you can, little girl,
Hide your head in the sand, little girl,
Catch you with another man, that's the end, little girl.

You laid it down for all to see,

One sunny day the world was waiting for a lover.
She came along to turn on ev'ryone.
Sexy Sadie, the greatest of them all, Sexy Sadie.
Now did you know
The world was waiting just for you,
The world was waiting just for you,

You'll get yours yet.
However big you think you are,
However big you think you are.
Sexy Sadie,
Oh, you'll get yours yet.

We gave her ev'rything we owned just to sit at her table,
Just a smile would lighten ev'rything.
Sexy Sadie, the greatest of them all.

She came in through the bathroom window,
Protected by a silver spoon.
But now she sucks her thumb and wonders
By the banks of her own lagoon.

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday;
Tuesday's on the phone to me.

She said she'd always been a dancer,
She worked at fifteen clubs a day.
And though she thought I knew the answer;
Well, I knew that I could not say.

And so I quit the police department,
And got myself a steady job.
And though she tried her best to help me;
She could steal, but she could not rob.

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday;
Tuesday's on the phone to me.

You think you've lost your love,
Well I saw her yesterday-yi-yay.
It's you she's thinking of,
And she told me what to say-yi-yay.

She says she loves you
And you know that can't be bad,
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad.
Oo, she loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah,
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah,
And with love like that,
You know you should be glad.

She said you hurt her so
She almost lost her mind.
And now she says she knows
You're not the hurting kind.

She says she loves you
And you know that can't be bad,
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad.
Oo, she loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah,
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah,
And with love like that,
You know you should be glad.

You know it's up to you,
I think it's only fair,
Pride can hurt you too,
Apologize to her

Because she loves you
And you know that can't be bad,
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad.
Oo, she loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah,
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah,
And with love like that,
You know you should be glad.

Only ever has to give me love forever and forever,
My love don't give me presents.

Turn me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only foolin',
I know she isn't.

She don't give boys the eye,
She hates to see me cry,
She is happy just to hear me say
That I will never leave her,
She don't give boys the eye.

She will never make me jealous,
Gives me all her time as well as lovin',
Don't ask me why.

She's a woman who understands,
She's a woman who loves her man.

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover.
Something in the way she woos me

I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how.

Something in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover.
Something in her style that shows me

I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how.

You're asking me will my love grow,
I don't know, I don't know.
You stick around now it may show,
I don't know, I don't know.

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her.
Something in the thing she shows me

I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how.

Step inside, love, let me find you a place
Where the cares of the day
Will be carried away by the smile on your face.
We are together now and forever, come my way.

Step inside, love and stay, step inside, love.
Step inside, love, step inside, love, I want you to stay.

You look tired love, let me turn down the light,
Come in out of the cold,
Rest your head on my shoulder and love me tonight.
I'll always be here if you should need me, night and day.

Step inside, love and stay, step inside, love.
Step inside, love, step inside, love, I want you to stay.

When you leave me, say you'll see me again,
For I'll know in my heart
We will not be apart and I'll miss you till then.
We'll be together now and forever, come my way.

Step inside, love and stay, step inside, love.
Step inside, love, step inside, love, I want you to stay.

Day after day alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still,
But nobody wants to know him,
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer.

But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning 'round.

Well on the way, head in a cloud,
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud,
But nobody ever hears him,
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice.

But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning 'round.

And nobody seems to like him,
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings.

But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning 'round.

He never listens to them,
He knows that they're the fools.
They don't like him.

But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning 'round.

Without going out of my door
I can know all things on earth.
Without looking out on my window
I could know the ways of heaven.

The farther one travels the less one knows, the less one knows.

Without going out of my door
You can know all things on earth.
Without looking out on my window
You could know the ways of heaven.

The farther one travels the less one knows, the less one knows.

Arrive without traveling,
See all without looking.

The long and winding road that leads to your door,
Will never disappear I've seen that road before,
It always leads me here
Lead me to your door.

The wild and windy night that the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day
Why leave me standing here
Let me know the way.

Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyway you'll never know
The many ways I've tried but

Still they lead me back to the long winding road
You left me standing here a long long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to your door.

We said our goodbyes,
Love was in your eyes,
Now today I find
You have changed you mind
Treat me like you did the night before.

Were you telling lies?
Was I so unwise?
When I held you near
You were so sincere,
Treat me like you did the night before.

Last night is the night
I will remember you by
When I think of things we did
It makes me wanna cry.

We said our goodbyes,

Say the word and you'll be free,
Say the word and be like me.
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, it's sunshine,
It's the word love.

In the beginning I misunderstood,
But now I've got it, the word is good;

Say the word and you'll be free,
Say the word and be like me.
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, it's sunshine,
It's the word love.

Ev'rywhere I go I hear it said,
In the good and the bad books that I have read,

Say the word and you'll be free,
Say the word and be like me.
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, it's sunshine,
It's the word love.

Now that I know what I feel must be right.
I mean to show ev'rybody the light.

Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way.
It's the word I'm thinking of
And the only word is love
It's so fine, it's sunshine,
It's the word love.
Say the word, love.
Say the word, love.

There there's a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue;
And it's my mind
And there's no time
When I'm alone.

I I think of you
And things you do
Go round my head
The things you're said
Like I love only you.

In my mind there's no sorrow
Don't you know that it's so
There'll be no sad tomorrow
Don't you know that it's so.

There oh there a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue;
And it's my mind
And there's no time
When I'm alone.
There's a place,
There's a place.

You say you will love me
If I have to go.
You'll be thinking of me,
Somehow I will know.
Someday when I'm lonely
Wishing you weren't so far away,
Then I will remember
Things we said today.

You say you'll be mine girl
'Til the end of time
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find.
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love not a lot to say,
Then we will remember
Things we said today.

Me, I'm just the lucky kind,
Love to hear you say that love is love.
And though we may be blind
Love is here to stay
And that's enough
To make you mine girl,
Be the only one.
Love me all the time girl,
We'll go on and on.
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love not a lot to say,
Then we will remember
Things we said today.

Me, I'm just the lucky kind,
Love to hear you say that love is love.
And though we may be blind
Love is here to stay
And that's enough
To make you mine girl,
Be the only one.
Love me all the time girl,
We'll go on and on.
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love not a lot to say,
Then we will remember
Things we said today.

I've got a word or two
To say about the things that you do.
You've telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have if we close our eyes.

Do what you want to do,
And go where you're going to.
Think for yourself 'cause I won't be there with you.

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you had in mind.
And though you still can't see,
I know your mind's made up, you're gonna cause more misery.

Do what you want to do,
And go where you're going to.
Think for yourself 'cause I won't be there with you.

Although your mind's opaque,
Try thinking more if just for your own sake.
The future still looks good
And you've got time to rectify all the things that you should.

Do what you want to do,
And go where you're going to.
Think for yourself 'cause I won't be there with you.
Do what you want to do,
And go where you're going to.
Think for yourself 'cause I won't be there with you,
Think for yourself 'cause I won't be there with you.

That boy took my love away.
Oh, he'll regret it some day,
But this boy wants you back again.

That boy isn't good for you.
Though he may want you too,
This boy wants you back again.

Oh, and this boy would be happy just to love you,
But oh my-yi-yi-yi, that boy won't be happy
Till he's seen you cry hi-hi-hi.

This boy wouldn't mind the pain,
Would always feel the same
If this boy gets you back again.
This boy, this boy.

I think I'm gonna be sad. I think it's today, yeah!
Girl that's driving me mad is going away.

She's got a ticket to ride,
She's got a ticket to ri-hi-hide,
She's got a ticket to ride,
But she don't care.

She said that living with me is bringing her down, yeah!
She would never be free when I was around.

She's got a ticket to ride,
She's got a ticket to ri-hi-hide,
She's got a ticket to ride,
But she don't care.

I care, my baby don't know why she's riding so high.
She ought to think right,
She ought to do right by me.
Before she gets to staying goodbye.
She ought to think right,
She ought to do right by me.

I think I'm gonna be sad. I think it's today, yeah!
Girl that's driving me mad is going away.

She's got a ticket to ride,
She's got a ticket to ri-hi-hide,
She's got a ticket to ride,
But she don't care.

She said that living with me is bringing her down, yeah!
She would never be free when I was around.

She's got a ticket to ride,
She's got a ticket to ri-hi-hide,
She's got a ticket to ride,
But she don't care.
My baby don't care.

When I want to speak to you
If sometimes takes a week or two
To think of things I want to say to you.
But words just stay on the tip of my tongue.

When the skies are not so blue
There's nothing left for me to do
Just think of something how to say to you.
But words just stay on the tip of my tongue.

People say I'm lonely,
Only you know that's not true.
You know I'm waiting for a chance to prove my love to you.

Soon enough my time will come,
And after all is said and done
I'll marry you and we will live as one.
With no more words on the tip of my tongue, no more,
No words on the tip of my tongue.

Two of us riding nowhere,
Spending someone's hard earned pay.
You and me sunday driving,
Not ariving on our way back home,
We're on our way home,
We're on our way home,
We're going home.

Two of us sending postcards,
Writing letters on my wall.
You and me burning matches,
Lifting latches on our way back home,
We're on our way home,
We're on our way home,
We're going home.

You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead.

Two of us wearing raincoasts,
Standing solo in the sun.
You and me chasing paper,
Getting nowhere on our way back home.
We're on our way home,
We're on our way home,
We're going home.

You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead.

Two of us wearing raincoats,
Standing solo in the sun.
You and me chasing paper,
Getting nowhere on our way back home.
We're on our way home,
We're on our way home,
We're going home.

It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home.
I've been away now, oh, how, I've been alone.

Wait till I come back to your side,
We forget the tears we cried;

But if your heart breaks, don't wait, turn me away.
And if your heart's strong, hold on, I won't delay.

Wait till I come back to your side,
We forget the tears we cried;

I feel as though you ought to know
That I've been good, as good as I can be.
And if you do I'll trust in you
And know that you will wait for me.

It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home.
I've been away now, oh, how, I've been alone.

Wait till I come back to your side,
We forget the tears we cried;

I feel as though you ought to know
That I've been good, as good as I can be.
And if you do I'll trust in you
And know that you will wait for me.

But if your heart breaks, don't wait, turn me away.
And if your heart's strong, hold on, I won't delay.

Wait till I come back to your side,
We forget the tears we cried;

It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home.
I've been away now, oh, how, I've been alone.

Try to see it my way,
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on?
While you see it your way,
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone.

We can work it out,
We can work it out.

Think of what you're saying,
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright.
Think of what I'm saying,
We can work it out and get it straight or say goodnight.

We can work it out,
We can work it out.

Life is very short and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend.
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again.

Try to see it my way,
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong.
While you see it your way,
There's a chance that we might fall apart before too long.

We can work it out,
We can work it out.

Life is very short and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend.
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again.

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind.
What goes on in your mind?

The other day I sawed as I walked along the road,
But when I saw him with you I could feel my future fold.
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why.

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind.
What goes on in your mind?

I met you in the morning, waiting for the tides of time,
But now the tide is turn me I can see that I was blind.
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why.

What goes on in your heart?

I used to think of nobody else but you were just the same,
You didn't even think of me as someone with a name.
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die.
Tell me why.

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind.
What goes on in your mind?

Look what you're doing, I'm feeling blue and lonely
Would it be too much to ask of you what you're doing to me?

You got me running and there's no fun in it
Why should it be too much to ask of you what you're doing to me?

I've been waiting here for you, wond'ring what you're gonna do.
Should you need a love that's true, it's me.

Please stop your lying, you got me crying girl
Why should it be too much to ask of you what you're doing to me?

I've been waiting here for you, wond'ring what you're gonna do.
Should you need a love that's true, it's me.

Please stop your lying, you got me crying girl
Why should it be too much to ask of you what you're doing to me?
What you're doing to me?
What you're doing to me?

When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now,
Will you still be sending me a valentine,
Birthday greeting, bottle of wine.
If I'd been out till quarter to three,
Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
When I'm sixty four?

You'll be older too,
Ah, and if you say the word,
I could stay with you.

I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone.
You can knit a sweater by the fire side,
Sunday mornings, go for a ride.
Doing the garden, digging the weeds,
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
When I'm sixty four?

Ev'ry summer we can rent a cottage on the Isle of Wight
If it's not too dear.
We shall scrimp and save.
Ah, grandchildren on your knee,
Vera, Chuck and Dave.

Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view.
Indicate precisely what you mean to say,
You're sincerely wasting away.
Give me your answer, fill in a form,
Mine forever more,
Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
When I'm sixty four?

I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps.
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps.

I don't know why nobody told you
Now to untold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you.

I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps.
I with every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps.

I don't know how you were diverted you were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted no one alerted you.

I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps.
I look at you all
Still my guitar gently weeps.

What would you think if I sang out of tune,
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key,

Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends,
Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends,
Mm, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends.

What do I do when my love is away,
Does it worry you to be alone?
How do I feel by the end of the day,
Are you sad because you're on your own?

No, I get by with a little help from my friends,
Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends,
Mm, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends.

Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love.
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love.

Would you believe in a love at first sight?
Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time.
What do you see when you turn out the light?
I can't tell you but I know it's mine.

Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends,
Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends,
Mm, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends.

Do you need anybody?
I does need someone to love.
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love.

We were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion,
Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late when they pass away.

We were talking about the love we all could share,
When we find it to try our best to hold it there
With our love, with our love we could save the world.

Try to realize it's all within yourself no one else can make you change.
And to see you're really only very small and life flows on within you and without you.

We were talking about the love that's gone so cold
And the people who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know, they can't see. Are you one of them?

Please lock me away and don't allow the day here inside
Where I hide with my loneliness.

I don't care what they say,
I won't stay in a word without love.

Birds sing out of tune and rain drops hide the moon. I'm OK
Here I'll say with my loneliness.

I don't care what they say,
I won't stay in a word without love.

So I wait and in a smile I will see my true love smile.
She may come, I know not when, when she does I'll know,
So baby until then, lock me away and don't allow the day here inside
Where I hide with my loneliness.

I don't care what they say,
I won't stay in a word without love.

In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea,
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines,
So we sailed up to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine.

We all live in a yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
We all live in a yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.

And our friends are all on board;
Many more of them live next door;
And the band begins to play.

We all live in a yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
We all live in a yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.

As we live a life of ease,
Ev'ryone of us has all we need.
Sky of blue and sea of green
In our yellow submarine.

We all live in a yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
We all live in a yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
We all live in a yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
We all live in a yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.

Yes, I'm lonely. Wanna die.
Yes, I'm lonely. Wanna die.
If I ain't dead already.
Girl, you know the reason why.
In the morning wanna die.
In the evening wanna die.
Girl, you know the reason why.

My mother was of the sky.
My father was of the earth.
But I am of the universe
And you know what it's worth.

Yes, I'm lonely. Wanna die.
Yes, I'm lonely. Wanna die.
If I ain't dead already.
Girl, you know the reason why.

The eagle picks my eye
The worm, he licks my bone.
I feel so suicidal
Just like Dylan's Mister Jones.

Yes, I'm lonely. Wanna die.
Yes, I'm lonely. Wanna die.
If I ain't dead already.
Girl, you know the reason why.

The black cloud crossed my mind
Blue mist 'round my soul.
I feel so suicidal,
Even hate my rock and roll.

Yes, I'm lonely. Wanna die.
Yes, I'm lonely. Wanna die.
If I ain't dead already.
Girl, you know the reason why.

If you wear me tonight,
Remember what I said tonight,
For red is the color that my baby wore
And what's more it's true, yes it is.

Scarlet were the clothes she wore,
Ev'rybody know's I'm sure.
I would remember all the things we planned
Understand it's true, yes it is, it's true, yes it is.

I could be happy with you by my side
If I could forget her, but it's my pride.
Yes it is, yes it is, oh, yes it is, yeah.

Please don't wear red tonight,
This is what I said tonight,
For red is the color that will make me blue
In spite of you it's true, yes it is, it's true, yes it is, it's true.

Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away.
Now it look as though they're here to stay,
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be.
There's a shadow hanging over me,
Oh, yesterday, came suddenly.

Why she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say.
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.

Yesterday love was such an easy game to play,
Now I need a place to hide away,
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

Why she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say.
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.

Yesterday love was such an easy game to play,
Now I need a place to hide away,
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

I got something to say that might cause you pain;
If I catch you talking to that boy again,
I'm gonna let you down and leave you flat,
Because I told you before,
Oh, you can't do that.

Well, it's the second time I've caught you talking to him.
Do I have to tell you one more time I think it's a sin?
I think I'll let you down and leave you flat,
Because I've told you before,
Oh, you can't do that.

Ev'rybody's green
'Cause I'm the one who won your love
But if it's seen
You're talking that way, they'd laugh in my face.

So, please listen to me if you wanna stay mine.
I can't help my feeling, I'll go out of my mind.
I know I'll let you down and leave you flat,
Because I've told you before,
Oh, you can't do that.

Though you're gone away this morning, you'll be back again tonight,
Telling me there's be no next time if I just don't treat you right.

You'll never leave me and you know it's true,
'Cause you like me too much and I like you.

You've tried before to leave me but you haven't got the nerve
To walk out and make me lonely which is all that I desrve.

You'll never leave me and you know it's true,
'Cause you like me too much and I like you.

I really do,
And it's nice when you believe me,
If you leave me,
I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
'Cause I couldn't really stand it. I admit that I was wrong,
I wouldn't let you lee me 'cause it's true,
'Cause you like me too much and I like you.

To walk out and make me lonely which is all that I desrve.

You'll never leave me and you know it's true,
'Cause you like me too much and I like you.

I never give you my number,
I only give you my situation.
And in the middle of investigations, I break down.

Out of college, money spent,
See no future, pay no rent,
All the money's gone, nowhere to go.
Any jobber got the sack,
Monday morning turning back,
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go.

But, oh, that magic feeling nowhere to go,
Oh, that magic feeling nowhere to go,
Nowhere to go.

One sweet dream, pick up the bags, and get in the limousine.
Soon, we'll be away from here, step on the gas and wipe that tear away.
One sweet dream came true today,
Came true today,
Came true today.

I don't like you
But I love you
See that I'm always
Thinking of you
Oh, oh, oh,
You treat me badly
I love you madly
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

I don't want you,
But I need you
Don't want to kiss you
But I need you
Oh, oh, oh
You do me wring now
My love is strong now
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me

I want to leave you
Don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend
Another day here
Oh, oh, oh, I want to split now
I just can quit now
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me

You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me

When I call you up, your line's engaged.
I have had enough, so get your age.
We have lost the time that was so hard to find,
And I will lose my mind if you won't see me,
You won't see me.

I don't know why you should want to hide.
But I can't get through, my hands are tied.
I don't want to stay, I don't have much to say,
But I can turn away and you won't see me,
You won't see me.

Time after time you refuse to even listen.
I wouldn't mind if I knew what I was missin'.
Though the days are few, they're filled with tears.
And since I lost you it feels like years.
Yes it seems so long girl since you've been gone,
And I just can't go on if you won't see me,
You won't see me.

Let's all get up and dance to a song
That was a hit before your mother was born.
Though she was born a long long time ago,
Your mother should know,
Your mother should know.
Sing it again.

Let's all get up and dance to a song
That was a hit before your mother was born.
Though she was born a long long time ago,
Your mother should know,

Lift up your hearts and sing me a song

Though she was born a long long time ago,
Your mother should know,
Your mother should know,
Your mother should know,
Your mother should know.

Sing it again.
Though she was born a long long time ago,
Your mother should know,
Your mother should know,
Your mother should know,
Your mother should know.

Here I stand with head in hand,
Turn my face to the wall.
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two feet small.
Ev'rywhere people stare
Each and ev'ry day.
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say,
Hey, you've got to hide your love away!
Hey, you've got to hide your love away!

How can I ever try?
I can never win,
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in.
How could she say to me,
Love will find away?
Gather 'round all you clowns
Let me hear you say,
Hey, you've got to hide your love away!
Hey, you've got to hide your love away!
